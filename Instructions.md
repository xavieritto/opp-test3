# Instructions
**Do not** change the code in the following files:
 1. Score.h
 2. Score.cpp
 3. Student.h
 4. Student.cpp

## Task
You task is to complete the implementation in `main.cpp`. Select this file from the Explorer view on the left. This files has comments instructing you want to complete. Complete the implementation as outlined in the comment by placing your code under the lines denoted by ``\\YOUR CODE HERE``.

**Note**: The only sections you need to provide implmentation are in those with the comment ``\\YOUR CODE HERE``. Read **all** comments in the file.

To complete the implementation you are required to use the ``Score`` and ``Student`` classes that have been predefined. You may look at the those files but you are not allowed to edit them. Editing those files will result in **automatic zero**.

**Note**: You are **allowed** to use the book, your notes, and online sources.

**Note**: You are **not allowed** to use code generation tools, AI tools, or question-and-answer sources. This will result in an automatic zero, and steps further outlined in the syllabus.

# Sample Output

On successful completion of the implementation, your execution must be as shown below.
